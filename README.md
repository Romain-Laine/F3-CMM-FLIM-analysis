# F3-CMM-FLIM-analysis
This ImageJ macro code provides a fast and robust way to analyse FLIM (TCSPC) image data in ImgaeJ (or FiJi). The method is based on an extension of the centre-of-mass method (CMM) which uses the first moment to estimate the lifetime from a decay.

The dataset attached in "Example B&H dataset" are provided to test analysis on experimental dataset. This dataset are FLIM dataset of Convallaria root as .sdt file acquired on a custom-built confocal TCSPC microscope.
